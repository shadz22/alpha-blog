# Alpha Blog

---

## Outline

This is a Ruby on rails application, which allows users to create blogs/articles and have access to other users' blogs/articles. They can add categories to their articles, this means all the articles of a specific category can be viewed in that category's show page. The user muts be logged in to be able to create a new article or to amend their profile, but they don't have to be logged in to view other users's articles. Only an Admin can edit other users' articles or create new categories.
